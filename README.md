## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport, Multer, Cloudinary

My goal for this project was to create a simple social media website that worked with the basic functions. I worked with the engineers at 100devs to wireframe to eventually use MVC architecture. We wireframed collections for the users and posts. Last we added the ability to comment with a separate comments collection. 

## Optimizations

I have a lot of ideas about what can be added to this social media site. I'd add the ability for users to have friends and only see their information or not. Direct messages to friends. Right now users can like their own posts and anyone can like a post more than once, so I would change that. Also, the feed page needs a button, or some indication that when you click the picture you're viewing the post for that picture. 

## Lessons Learned:

I gained a much better understanding of EJS and the MVC architecture by doing this website and rubber-ducking everything.
